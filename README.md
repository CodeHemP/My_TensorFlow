# My_TensorFlow

- TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. 

- Itâ€™s a comprehensive and flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and other resources that provide workflows with high-level APIs. The framework offers various levels of concepts for you to choose the one you need to build and deploy machine learning models. For instance, if you need to do some large machine learning tasks, you can use the Distribution Strategy API in order to perform distributed hardware configurations and if you need a full production machine learning pipeline, you can simply use TensorFlow Extended (TFX). Some of the salient features are described below:

- Easy Model Building: TensorFlow offers multiple levels of abstraction to build and train models. 

- Robust ML Production Anywhere: TensorFlow lets you train and deploy your model easily, no matter what language or platform you use. 

- Powerful Experimentation For Research: TensorFlow gives you the flexibility and control with features like the Keras Functional API and Model Subclassing API for creation of complex topologies.
